# Coffee-Sales-Using-Excel
## Project Overview
This project involves creating a dynamic and interactive dashboard for analyzing coffee sales across different metrics such as roast type, size, loyalty card usage, and sales performance by country. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into sales trends over time and identify top-performing customers and regions, enabling strategic decision-making.
